* <h2>“Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning Models” – Published in 2022 International Congress on Human-Computer Interaction, Optimization and Robotic Applications(HORA)</h2>
  * This research used Binary Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC),
    Decision tree Classifier and Stacked Generalization (Stacking) to provide an accurate prediction of a flood.
  * To determine and evaluate the accuracy, several data pre-processing techniques were applied to the rainfall     datasset.
  * A comparative analysis was conducted to understand which model delivers better accuracy.
